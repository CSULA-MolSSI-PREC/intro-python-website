    "1. [Register](https://chemcompute.org/register/) for a ChemCompute account. The easiest thing to do is to choose \"Sign in with your University Login\" on the right. You can login using your university email. You will need to confirm account registration from an email chemcompute will send you.\n",
    "2. After confirming your account, you will be able to access a Jupyter notebook. The first time you start this workshop, you will need to get access to the files used in this workshop. Using the menu at the top, select \"Jupyter\" then \"Clone a github repo to your notebook\"\n",
    "3. There will be a form on the page. Enter `https://github.com/CSULA-MolSSI-PREC/prec-molssi-workshop` into the URL field and click \"Pull Repo\"\n",
    "4. A Jupyter notebook environment with the files you need will start for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only have to complete these steps once. Every other time you access ChemCompute, you will click \"Jupyter\" then \"Use Psi4 or JupyterHub\". Your files for this workshop will be in a folder called `prec-molssi-workshop`.\n",
